# Fantasy-Premier-League-in-R
Grabs data from the FPL API and creates a dataframe of all players in the English Premier League with their corresponding data, e.g. total points, goals, average points. Also creates .CSV files for data from each game week

Acknowledgement:

Updates:
I will keep the /gameweek_data/gw_csv folder updated by once every game week has concluded, including an updated clean merged .CSV file found in the /all_player_data folder.
